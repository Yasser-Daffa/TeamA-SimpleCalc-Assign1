# Team A â€” SimpleCalc (Assignment 1)

A simple multi-mode calculator with four functions:  
**Standard**, **Programmer**, **Scientific**, and **Converter** modes.  
Developed as a small group project by **Team A**.

## 1. Standard Mode  
**By:** Yehya & Mohammed Ali  

### Error Handling
1.  Used try-except to handle invalid numeric inputs.
2.  Checked for division by zero before dividing.
3.  isplayed custom error messages instead of crashing the program.
4.  Used loops to re-ask the user for correct input after an error.
5. Handled unexpected operation names with a validation check 

### Difficulties Faced
-  Understanding how to use try-except correctly at first.
-  Making sure indentation was correct to avoid syntax errors.

## 4. Converter Mode + Code Assembly & User Interface  
**By:** Yasser  

### Error Handling
The program returns an error message when:
1. User enters incorrect values, such as a string when an integer/float was expected.  
2. User enters a float/integer when a string was expected.  
3. User enters a single input when two or more were expected (separated by a comma).  
4. User enters multiple inputs when a single input was requested.  
5. User enters a float when an integer was requested.  
6. The user tries to enter a unit that doesn't exist in the unit table.

### Difficulties Faced
- I had major issues trying to format the printed output properly.  
- The schedule/user interface for the function took the most time, even though I initially thought it would be the easiest.
