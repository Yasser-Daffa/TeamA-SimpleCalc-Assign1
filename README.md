4- Converter Mode + code assembly& user interface:
 By:
   Yasser
   
  *Error handling:
   The program returns an error message when
   1- user enters incorrect values, such as a string when an integer/float was supposed to be entered
   2- user enters float/integer when string was supposed to be entered
   3- user enters a single input when two or more were supposed to be entered (separated by a comma)
   4- user enters multiple inputs when a single input was requested
   5- user enters a float when an integer was requested
   6- if the user tries to enter a unit that doesn't exist in the unit table.

 *Difficulty faced during the writing of this code:
   - I had massive issues when trying to formulate a proper formatted print function.
   - The schedule/user interface for the function took the most time. When I initially thought it would be the fastest to go through.
