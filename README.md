Error Handling

The program returns an error message when:

1. User enters incorrect values, such as a string when an integer/float was expected.

2. User enters a float/integer when a string was expected.

3. User enters a single input when two or more were expected (separated by a comma).

4. User enters multiple inputs when a single input was requested.

5. User enters a float when an integer was requested.

6. The user tries to enter a unit that doesn't exist in the unit table.

Difficulties Faced

I had major issues trying to format the printed output properly.

The schedule/user interface for the function took the most time, even though I initially thought it would be the easiest.
